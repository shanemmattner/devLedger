## Technical Evolution

### Architectural Decisions
- Python-based implementation
- Pattern-based comment tracking
- JSON/YAML storage format
- Git integration approach
- LLM integration strategy

### Design Patterns
- Command pattern for CLI
- Observer pattern for git hooks
- Strategy pattern for storage
- Factory pattern for components

### Implementation Choices
- Type hints throughout
- Async operations where beneficial
- Modular architecture
- Plugin system for extensibility
