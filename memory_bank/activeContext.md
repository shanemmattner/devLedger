# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are initiating the DevLedger project, focusing on establishing the core infrastructure and basic functionality for version 0.1.0.

## Recent Decisions

### 1. Project Structure
- Created memory bank for project documentation
- Established core architectural patterns
- Defined initial technology stack
- Outlined phased development approach
- Developed comprehensive memory bank integration plan
- Created LLM prompt template for standardized AI interaction with memory bank

### 2. Documentation Enhancements
- Created LLM prompt template to standardize AI interactions with the memory bank
- Improved comment structure with content levels (Debug, Info, etc.)
- Added support for tracking external documentation references in comment files
- Simplified comment metadata requirements

### 2. Technical Choices
- Python 3.8+ as base language
- JSON/YAML for knowledge storage
- Git-based tracking system
- Support for both local and cloud LLMs
- Enhanced memory bank with historical tracking and task management

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- Starting with core comment tracking
- Building minimal viable CLI
- Implementing basic git hooks
- Setting up essential storage structure
- Integrating memory bank with development workflow
- Standardizing LLM interactions with memory bank through prompt template

## Active Considerations
