# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are initiating the DevLedger project, focusing on establishing the core infrastructure and basic functionality for version 0.1.0.

## Recent Decisions

### 1. Project Structure
- Created memory bank for project documentation
- Established core architectural patterns
- Defined initial technology stack
- Outlined phased development approach

### 2. Technical Choices
- Python 3.8+ as base language
- JSON/YAML for knowledge storage
- Git-based tracking system
- Support for both local and cloud LLMs

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- Starting with core comment tracking
- Building minimal viable CLI
- Implementing basic git hooks
- Setting up essential storage structure

## Active Considerations

### 1. Core Components

    A[Comment Tracking] --> B[Storage System]
    B --> C[Git Integration]
    C --> D[CLI Interface]
    D --> E[Basic LLM Support]
```

### 2. Immediate Priorities
1. Set up project structure
2. Implement basic comment parsing
3. Create storage system
4. Build CLI foundation
5. Add git hook integration

### 3. Open Questions
- Best approach for pattern matching performance
- Storage format optimization strategy
- LLM integration architecture
- Testing methodology

## Next Steps

### 1. Development Setup

- Initial setup phase
- Core architecture defined
- Development planning
- Team alignment

### 2. Key Metrics
- Project setup: 0%
- Core functionality: 0%
- Documentation: 10%
- Testing coverage: 0%

### 3. Blockers
- None currently identified

### 4. Dependencies
- Python environment
- Git integration
- LLM services (planned)
- Storage backend (planned)

## Immediate Action Items

### This Week
1. Set up project repository structure
2. Create initial package configuration
3. Implement basic comment parsing
4. Begin storage system development

### Next Week
1. Continue core implementation
2. Add basic CLI functionality
3. Begin git hook integration
4. Start testing framework

## Notes and Observations

### Technical
- Need to carefully consider pattern matching performance
- Storage system should be optimized for frequent updates
- Git integration needs robust error handling
- CLI should prioritize user experience

### Process
- Documentation should evolve with implementation
- Testing should be comprehensive from start
- User feedback should guide development
- Performance metrics need monitoring

## Learning Points
