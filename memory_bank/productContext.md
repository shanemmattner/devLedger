# Product Context

## Problem Space

### Core Challenges
1. **Knowledge Attrition**
   - Critical context lost when team members leave
   - Historical decisions become unclear over time
   - Implementation rationale gets forgotten

2. **Documentation Resistance**
   - Engineers avoid comprehensive documentation
   - Documentation becomes outdated quickly
   - Knowledge capture disrupts workflow

3. **Cross-Domain Fragmentation**
   - Hardware and software knowledge silos
   - Disconnected documentation systems
   - Lost relationships between components

4. **Knowledge Transfer Inefficiency**
   - Time-consuming onboarding processes
   - Repeated explanation of design decisions
   - Difficulty finding relevant information

## Solution Vision

### Core Principles
1. **Minimal Friction**
   - Seamless integration with existing workflows
   - Natural language interaction
   - Automated knowledge capture

2. **Structural Understanding**
   - Code-linked knowledge
   - Hardware-software relationships
   - Pattern-based tracking

3. **Evolution Support**
   - Knowledge grows with the codebase
   - Maintains historical context
   - Adapts to changing requirements

4. **Intelligent Assistance**
   - LLM-powered insights
   - Natural language queries
   - Context-aware suggestions
